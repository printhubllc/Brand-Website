            <strong>Shipping Options and Costs:</strong>
            <br />

              <strong>Standard Delivery:</strong> Typically takes 5-7 business
              days. Shipping fees are based on the delivery location and order
              size.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Express Delivery:</strong> Generally delivers within 2-3

              <strong>Next-Day Delivery:</strong> Available for orders placed
